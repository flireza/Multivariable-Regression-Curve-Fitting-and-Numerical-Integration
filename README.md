- Created a 3D least squares surface model for upper/lower mineral deposit surfaces using borehole data.
- Computed estimated average thickness and volume of the mineral deposit over a 2km x 2km site.
- Applied Lagrange and Divided Differences methods to interpolate polynomials from sample data.
- Verified exact integral values using symbolic computation and compared them to numerical estimates from:
  - Simpsonâ€™s Rule  
  - Trapezoidal Rule  
  - Gauss Quadrature  
  - Romberg Integration
- Demonstrated high-accuracy approximations and discussed error behavior analytically.
